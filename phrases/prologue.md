# Prologue on Phrases for writing and speaking

Essentially, there are a lot of types of phrases. One example is the introductory phrases, which introduces a sentence, or a preface for a chapter or a book. Another type is the connecting phrases , which essentially entail connecting two sentences together in a tight logic, and depending on the predicate logic, the final statement holds. Other types are not so common, but may be encountered, including, but not limited to, ending or finalizing statements.
