# English Writing

> This guide could be applied to any humanitarian processable language that concludes lexical resources, grammar, and sentences.

## Table of content: 
* Question and tasks identification and interpretations.
* Generalized structure for writing.
* Problems identification (aka. goals).
* Problems Modelling (e.g., decomposition and finding interrelationships).
* Principles of Scientific Modelling in the context of the academic writing.
* Principles of Timing task goals.
* Ideas for training: 
  - Start by writing about something in your work that you know by heart (e.g., Case Reports for Medical Physicians - Text Summary - Documentation and tutorial manuals).
  - Try to apply your lexical resources, grammatical tricks, and explanatory maneuvers in writing as much as you could.
  - An advancement for that, is writing about your daily life, so each day at the end of the day or at the beginning of the next day think about yesterday, and try to choose multiple dates, and write about them to gain a range of grammatical~lexical combinations in practice.
  - Try to compare multiple days after writing them on another day as far as you could; because critical thinking, linking, and comparisons are healthy habits for logical academic minds.
